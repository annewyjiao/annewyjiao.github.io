      I am a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University. 
      But before that I was a kid video game addict, 
      a middle schooler who was way too obsessed with Big Hero 6, and 
      a confused teen who accidently signed up for a game jam. 
      Now my goal in life is to create a little robot friend 
      that listens to my problems. 
      <br> <br>
      This is my portfolio website
      where I have examples of my work. Go check it out! <br><br>

              <p>I made a platformer game using Python for PixelPad's 2021 March Break Game Jam.
                I developed character assets, levels and story routes. 
                The game was awarded Best Story and is one of the most played games on the site.

                This project was completed with a partner.
