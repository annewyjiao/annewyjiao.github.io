          Hi, I'm Anne, a Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University!
          I developed a passion for robotics when I watched Big Hero 6 as a kid,
          but it wasn’t until I participated in my first game jam that I became interested in computing science.
          I loved tinkering with my game, using problem solving and attention to detail to polish it; skills
          I continue to hone throughout my degree. My goal in the future is to make a little robot friend to keep me
          company. Beyond university, I’ve always seen myself as a creative person. I love drawing,
          making vlogs, scrapbooking, knitting, and cooking. I'm especially happy that I can incorporate
          creativity into both my studies and personal projects.
